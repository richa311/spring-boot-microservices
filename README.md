# spring-boot-microservices

A simple example of setting up a microservices system using Spring, Spring Boot and Spring Cloud. Microservices allow large systems to be built up from a number of collaborating components. ... The Web-Application will make requests to the microservice using a RESTful API.

Microservices are a software development techniqueâ€”a variant of the service-oriented architecture architectural style that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled services. In a microservices architecture, services are fine-grained and the protocols are lightweight.

Eureka Server is an application that holds the information about all client-service applications. Every Micro service will register into the Eureka server and Eureka server knows all the client applications running on each port and IP address. Eureka Server is also known as Discovery Server.
